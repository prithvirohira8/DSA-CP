A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree with the convention that 
the left child is smaller than the parent and 
the right child is greater than the parent.

It is 'not' a perfect binary tree such that each node has to have 2 children.

A binary search tree cannot have 2 nodes with the same values.
The values on all nodes need to be distinct.

IMP: The inorder traversal of the BST would print the values in a sorted order
