Data Structures, Algorithms and Optimized Approaches to solve Problems

Time Comlexity with respect to constraints
✅ N ≤ 10 → Try all possibilities (Brute-force, Backtracking).
✅ N ≤ 50 → Exponential time is fine (Subset Generation, Recursion).
✅ N ≤ 500 → Triple nested loops work (Cubic, DP, Matrix Operations).
✅ N ≤ 5000 → Quadratic solutions are okay (O(N²) DP, Graph Algorithms).
✅ N ≤ 10⁶ → Stick to O(N log N) or O(N) (Sorting, Greedy, Efficient DP).
✅ N ≥ 10⁹ → Brute force is impossible. Use O(log N) or O(1) (Binary Search, Math Tricks).

Common Brute Force Approaches:
Cost for generating:

a) Sub Arrays: O(n^2)
Approach: Brute Force

b) Sub Sets: O(2^n)
ApproachL Take it or Leave it

c)
