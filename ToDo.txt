1. Understand how to use the Comparator interface for both minHeaps & maxHeaps.
(Using Priority Queues)
2. What does ammortized mean? Auxiliary space mean?
3. Design a LinkedList & Doubly LinkedList by yourself
4. .remove() does it removie values based on indexes or on the values.
 Check for all data structures like list, map, set, linkedHashSet
5. How to remove the first and last elements of the above data structures
6. Add Syntax for Deque in Cheats.java file.


MOST Important:
8: Pass by value vs Pass by reference
List, Arrays, Sets, Queues, Maps are all reference types, passing them in 
functions and modifying values/ performing operations will lead to the changes seen globally

int, String, char, double, float, long are all primitives, passing them in functions
and modifying values/ performing operations will only change values locally.

9: Sorting a Priority Queue based on Pair
